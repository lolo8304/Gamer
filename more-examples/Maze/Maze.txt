This is a scrolling maze game in which you have to travel from the top-left
corner of a maze to the bottom-right corner. The screen shows you in the
centre of the screen, with the maze all around you. Press one of the direction
buttons to start moving in that direction, if that is possible.

If you reach the opposite corner, a new random maze will be generated.

If you find the maze too small, you can try the source code given maze.inobig,
which generates a larger maze. Note that it takes a while to generate such a
large maze, so a progress 'bar' is shown during generation.
