An improved version of the Snake example game supplied with the DIY-gamer.

Move the snake around using the direction buttons. Note that the screen wraps
around. Try to eat as much as you can to grow the snake as long as possible.
If you eat yourself, however, then the game ends.


The main improvements are:
 - Rewritten and improved scrolling text routine, with redesigned letter font.
 - Shortened score display routine and redesigned digit font.
 - Several parts rewritten to be shorter and/or clearer.
 - Removed unused code
 - Fixed bug to allow food to appear on 8th column or row.

Update:
- Removed scrolling text routine an score display routine as they have become
   part of the Gamer library.
