A two-dimensional Nim game, played against the DIY-gamer.

The game board consists of a 4x4 grid of pieces (each displayed as a
2x2 square of pixels). A turn consists of removing a 1xN or Nx1 rectangle
of pieces, where N is any number from 1 to 4. The player to take the
last piece wins the game.

When it is your turn, move the flashing cursor using the buttons. Select
a piece that is one end of the rectangle you want to remove, and press the
Start button. Move the cursor to the other end of the rectangle you want
to remove, and press Start again. The move is then performed, removing the
selected rectangle.

The Gamer will then calculate its move. While it is contemplating, the
red LED lights up.

If you take the last piece and win, a spiral animation will be shown.
If the Gamer takes the last piece, you lose and a vertical wipe animation
is shown. The game then restarts.

You can quit a game prematurely by pressing Up and Start simultaneously.
If you want the Gamer to make the next move, then press Down and Start
simultaneously. This is especially useful at the start of the game, if you
want the Gamer to make the first move.
