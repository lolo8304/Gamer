Based on GamerTicTacToe1P from twsu.

A Tic-Tac-Toe or Noughts & Crosses game, played against the DIY-gamer.

Move the flashing cursor with the arrow buttons to an empty spot,
and press the Start button to place your piece. The Gamer will then
immediately play its move.

You can quit a game prematurely by pressing Up and Start simultaneously.
If you want the Gamer to make the next move, then press Down and Start
simultaneously. This is especially useful at the start of the game, if you
want the Gamer to make the first move.
